# Angular Hero Kata

"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of code-crafting. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic." -- Professor Snape

## Introduction 

Throughout this kata, we want you to get familiar with the fundamentals of Angular. This application will build a resource arena for managing heroes

By the end of this kata we hope to accomplish the following:
- Use built-in NG directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data
- Create NG components to display hero details and show an array of heroes
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks
- Enable users to select a hero fron a master list and edit that hero in the details view
- Format data with pipes
- Create a shared service to assemble the heroes
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components

### Step Uno, Create Repo

Run `ng new <NAME>`
Allow Routing
Enable CSS

### Step Dos, 

Something

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
